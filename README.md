This app was created using Flutter v3.3.1. The project is configured to use [fvm](https://fvm.app), so you can use it.

You can see a version of the finished app, in the following [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11a9yfaMzOMRpgM5xfT9MFcy5B8h4IxXN/view?usp=sharing).

### Run the project

If you are in VS Code just hit the play button or press f5.

If you like the terminal: `flutter run lib/main.dart` or `fvm flutter run lib/main.dart`

### About Redux

This time I decided to use [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) as the application's global state management. The reason is that I simply know it better and I have been working with it for a longer time. So I was able to implement it faster and spend more time designing the app and animations.

Anyway, I also think that Redux is a good state manager and I have no problem using it in projects.
